# GNA - Gaussian & Neural Accelerator Library repository
[![LGPL-2.1-or-later](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-lgpl_2.1_or_later-green.svg)](LICENSE)

Intel® Gaussian & Neural Accelerator is a low-power neural coprocessor for continuous inference at the edge.

When power and performance are critical, the Intel® Gaussian & Neural Accelerator (Intel® GNA) provides power-efficient, always-on support. Intel® GNA is designed to deliver AI speech and audio applications such as neural noise cancellation, while simultaneously freeing up CPU resources for overall system performance and responsiveness.

GNA library provides an API to run inference on Intel® GNA hardware, as well as in the software execution mode on CPU.

GNA library is also a part of [OpenVINO™](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino).

Intel® GNA hardware requires a driver to be installed on the system. For Windows\* please see:
[Intel® Drivers \& Software](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/30139/Intel-GNA-Scoring-Accelerator-Driver-for-Intel-NUC11TN?wapkw=gna) or Windows\* Update.
